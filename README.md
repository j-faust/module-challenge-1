## Project Purpose

Within this project I updated several code lines to add more accesibility within the webpage. This was done by adding 'alt' text to the images within the HTML code and additionally structuring the code in a more logical order. The following updates were made to the code: 

### HTML

* Added accessible 'alt' attributes to images on the webpage.

* Added "section" "header" and "footer" elements within the HTML to better denote the section purpose.

* Added descriptive comments to inform of changes made on the code and why they were made.

* The title for the webpage has been changed to be more concise and to assist with Search Engine Optimizaton.

* Corrected the link for 'Search Engine Optimization' to correctly link to it's section on the webpage.

### CSS 

* Consolidated the h1, h2, h3 within CSS code to global definition at the top. This was done to eliminate redundant coding within the CSS file.
